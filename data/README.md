# Dataset Information

The cryptocurrency data used is the BTC/USDT pair. Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. It is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies and was at the forefront of the rise of cryptocurrency. Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin that is designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar, usually through backing by fiat currency reserves. A cryptocurrency pair is a trading pair that consists of two different cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged for one another on a cryptocurrency exchange. In other words, a cryptocurrency pair represents the relative value of one cryptocurrency in terms of another cryptocurrency.
